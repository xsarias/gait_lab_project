# ü§ñ Dynamical Systems Analysis & Design‚úèÔ∏è
This agent has a particular architecture, so is important to define all components, sensors, actuators, inputs, outputs, all of these help to design a system diagram with the relationships, modules and data flow. <br>
## ‚úÖ  System Dynamics Analysis
The requirements section defines how sensors, transmitters and reward functions are integrated within the gait lab environment. It also describes the main use cases, focusing on the interactions between the agent and the environment to achieve goals such as adaptive learning, improved user performance, and personalization of clinical reports. <br>
