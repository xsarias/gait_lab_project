#  🤖 Machine Learning & Cybernetics Implementation 🤖

This project is the third phase of a multi-part academic investigation into the design and implementation of an intelligent gait laboratory agent. The agent is capable of analyzing human walking patterns and generating personalized recommendations based on real-time sensor data and reinforcement learning techniques.
📍[Workshop 3 report](workshop_3_report.pdf)
## 🎯 Objectives

- Integrate previous system modeling (Workshops 1 & 2) with Machine Learning.
- Implement a feedback-driven gait analysis agent using cybernetic principles.
- Incorporate reinforcement learning for continuous agent adaptation.
- Evaluate system stability, convergence, and clinical relevance.

## 🧩 System Architecture

The agent architecture is based on a **single-agent system** with the following core components:

- **Insight Engine**: Evaluates gait data and produces recommendations.
- **Feedback Loops**:
  - *Internal (Self-Adjustment)*: The agent refines its strategy through performance evaluation.
  - *External (Patient Performance)*: Real-world results from patient behavior influence agent learning.
  - *Expert Review*: A specialist can rate recommendations, reinforcing or correcting the model.

- **Inputs**: Kinematic and dynamic sensor data (e.g., EMG, force platforms, motion tracking).
- **Outputs**: Tailored recommendations aimed at improving walking efficiency and balance.


## 🤖 Machine Learning Implementation 

### Potential Algorithms

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Applied due to the high dimensionality of gait data.
- **Q-Learning**: Considered for baseline comparisons.
  
### Frameworks

- `Stable-Baselines3`: RL agent training in simulated or real gait environments.
- `PyTorch`: Custom neural network construction and Q-value approximation.
- `TensorFlow`: Optional alternative with Keras and TensorBoard integration.



## 🔄 Sensor-to-Reward Mapping

Sensor inputs are mapped to a **multi-level reward system** based on biomechanical efficiency and clinical relevance. Positive rewards are given for improvements in:

- Symmetry
- Balance
- Energy efficiency
- Phase timing

Negative or adjusted rewards occur in the presence of:

- Instability
- Poor environmental conditions
- Non-relevant recommendations (as judged by a specialist)

> A detailed mapping table is included in the report (Table 1).



## 🧪 Testing and Evaluation

### Experimental Scenarios

The agent will be tested under varying conditions:

- Physiological (fatigue, injury, medication effects)
- Environmental (lighting, sensor interference)
- Systemic (platform instability, feedback mismatches)

### Metrics

- **Biomechanical**:
  - Energy expenditure
  - Gait symmetry (Robinson et al. index)
  - Balance control
  - Deviation from ideal path
- **Agent-Specific**:
  - Recommendation accuracy
  - Specialist agreement
  - Convergence speed



## 📈 Learning Process

The agent’s learning path involves:

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Condition Evaluation**
3. **Recommendation Generation**
4. **Feedback Integration**
5. **Strategy Adjustment**

Convergence and stability are key design goals, validated through behavioral consistency and metric improvements over time.


## 🤖 Mono-Agent 🤖

The system operates around a single intelligent agent. All interaction is one-to-one with the patient, and expert feedback is treated as **external validation** rather than as a second agent. Therefore, this is clearly a **mono-agent system**.
